# ESBMC

## What is it?

-   ESBMC is an open source, permissively licensed, context-bounded model checker based on satisfiability modulo theories for the verification of single- and multi-threaded C/C++ programs. It does not require the user to annotate the programs with pre- or postconditions, but allows the user to state additional properties using assert-statements, that are then checked as well. Furthermore, ESBMC provides two approaches (lazy and schedule recording) to model check multi-threaded programs. It converts the verification conditions using different background theories and passes them directly to an SMT solver.
